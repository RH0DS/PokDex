# PokDex backend
 The backend logic for PokDex application.
 This will handle all dealings with the database, login logic, the communication with the external Pokemon API and to serve the frontend part of this project with the required data. 

 This is an ongoing process of creating this application and is done "on the fly" with no prior heads up or knowlage about the project. The goal is to see how I work with this kind of assignment and a limited amount of time to complete the task. 

 I will try to use a MVP, vertical slice method, and then expand from there as time allows. 

 As of writing this I have just created a git repo and have had a quickish look through the different frameworks needed and what the guidlines for this task are... so here we go! 

Before I start to code I have an inital plan to have a local docker setup with a sql database and i'll try and open up a port on this machine (wich I've never done before) and make the frontend accessable for the public to try the application out instead of hosting it on Azure as I've done multiple times before (everyday is a schoolday!).
